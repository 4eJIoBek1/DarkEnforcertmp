Nothing should be ignored based on the provided file changes. The only modified file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file (`.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml`), which is a legitimate source/config file that should not be ignored. There are no build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files in the changes that would warrant adding ignore rules.
